# Look-up Tables

The Excel look-up tables provide full estimation information for all available groups. 
The information is selectively displayed under the "Summary" tab of the toolbox based on user-specified age, atlas, ROI, and specificity % cutoff

Data are organized in 3 tabs for each atlas type:

[atlasname]: All available ROIs in the atlas  
[#_Lnd]: Specificity values are organized based on ROI-to-Channel mapping  
[#_Chn]: Specificity values are organized based on Channel-to-ROI mapping

Data visualization and summary statistics can be produced using the ROI-to-Channel mapping [#_Lnd] data. The data exploration can help users to determine an appropriate specificity cut-off based on the ROI(s), age group(s), and available source and detector optodes.
