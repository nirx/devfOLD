## Look-up Tables ##

The Excel look-up tables provide full estimation information for the 3months, 6months, and adults groups. 
The information is selectively displayed under the "Summary" tab of the toolbox based on user-specified age ("3Months", "6Months", "Adults"), atlas, ROI, and specificity % cutoff.
